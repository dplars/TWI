For installing OpenCV on Mac and using it in PyCharm, follow these steps:

Prerequisites: Python 2.7 or 3xx, virtualenv and OpenCV installed.

Open a terminal and create a virtual environment, pyimagesearch here

$ mkvirtualenv pyimagesearch
Step 2 is miscellaneous, depending on your needs.

pip install numpy

pip install scipy

pip install matplotlib
Sym-link your cv2.so and cv.py files. (only cv2.so files for OpenCV 3xx ). On my system, OpenCV is installed in /usr/local/lib/python/2.7/site_packages/

$ cd ~/.virtualenvs/pyimagesearch/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

$ ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cv.py cv.py

$ ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cv2.so cv2.so
These steps are essentially for setting up this virtual environment for PyCharm.
Open up PyCharm and create a new "Pure Python" project

Set up the location of our Python Interpreter. By default, PyCharm will point to the system install of Python, however, for our case we need it to point to the virtual environment pyimagesearch.

So click on the gear icon and select "Add Local". In my case, the pyimagesearch  virtual environment is located in  ~/.virtualenvs/pyimagesearch/ with the actual Python binary in  ~/.virtualenvs/pyimagesearch/bin. Once you have successfully navigated to your folder, choose the virtual environment binary which is python2.7 in the bin folder for me.

Hope it helps!

After this, you are all set. PyCharm will use your pyimagesearch virtual environment and will recognize the OpenCV library.
