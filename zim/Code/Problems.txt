====== Problems ======
Created vrijdag 13 november 2020

First problem encountered is that the communication or the delay between sending out a command from the python script and the action is pretty long -> 1.5s wait time before the next action can take place. this is to long.. [[+arduino_loop_time]] searches the roots of this problem
