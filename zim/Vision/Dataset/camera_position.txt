====== camera position ======
Created woensdag 11 november 2020

1st test was with a camera position more to the side of the cutting plates. This resulted in a bad reflection angle since the light came from the wrong side. Documentation of this set is in [[automated datasets:1 check camera position:1 camera position side]]
