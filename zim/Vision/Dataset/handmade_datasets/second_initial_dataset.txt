====== second initial dataset ======
Created vrijdag 04 december 2020

With the second number of inserts (batch 11 to 19) another dataset was created for measurement.
Since the photo's where labeled with two inserts at a time; the images taken where not relevant for the data processing and were not saved

The distance for these inserts is measured between the line connecting the two highest points visible on the insert and the outer most point of the wear area.
