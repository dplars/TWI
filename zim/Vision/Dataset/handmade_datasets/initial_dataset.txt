====== initial dataset ======
Created vrijdag 13 november 2020

===== Form =====
The dataset given where taken with a microscopic camera at Sirris. These images were in good lighting conditions for the measurement, but had a lot of extra "unwanted" features on it. The background was very like the wear and the rest of the tool insert. 
Every insert that was measured had a little mark on one side to mark the a and b. Sadly the information about what the marker meant is lost. To find the corresponding values, the inserts where once again put through a microscopic camera and the new pictures where compared against the old ones. 

While again checking the inserts out, a new dataset is created since this didn't ask much more time. During this proces there is also a new way of separating the sides of the inserts. There is a bullet at one side on every insert. This is an easy way to recognise a side and wont dissapear like the marker line.
