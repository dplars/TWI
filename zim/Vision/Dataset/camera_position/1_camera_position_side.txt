====== 1 camera position side ======
Created woensdag 11 november 2020

===== Camera position on the side =====
Taken on the first 4 plates of batch 04 with red lighting only from the adressable led strips. 

1st light position is made with a setup with two led strips where one image is taken for every set of two led lights. 
output is bad. Reflection angle wasn't good.

The images that where taken with this setup are found here:
Due to the problems with the arduino communications described [[:Code:Problems:arduino loop time|here]] the first dataset wasn't successfull because the leds didn't turn on when the photo's where taken. So the results are all black pictures with al little shadow of the insert caused by the polluting light.
