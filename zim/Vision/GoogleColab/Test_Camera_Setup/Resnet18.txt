====== Resnet18 ======
Created woensdag 18 november 2020

In this page we will describe the results and actions taken to get results out of Resnet18

this paper suggests that this is a good architecture for a quite like problem. where a low amount of data is used.
	//SDD-CNN: Small data-driven convolution neural networks for subtle roller defect inspection//

===== Creating first file =====

===== TSU_Resnet18_1 =====

failed to load data, did copy files into correct directories and created dataset class

===== TSU_Resnet18_2 =====

Simpeler method to read in data and not be able to change a lot of things;
next time build dataset class self with the same model. 
After that the regression model would be easy

First result of the training.

Tweede test met een aanpassing van de learning rate en een foto van de training set naar test set gebracht

Next time create results file to get nice overview of all results
