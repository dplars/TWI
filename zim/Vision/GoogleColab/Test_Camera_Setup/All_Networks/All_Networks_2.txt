====== All Networks 2 ======
Created vrijdag 04 december 2020

===== Network architectures =====
This model is used to test different model architectures namely:
* Resnet18
* Alexnet
* VGG11_bn
* Squeezenet
* Densenet

inception v3 didn't seem to work

These models are all relatively small and should provide quite good results for a small dataset. 
More on why the models should work can be found [[Research:Vision Algorithm:camera position validation|here]]

===== Dataset =====

This algorithm had the input of images from the [[Dataset:handmade datasets:Second handmade dataset|Second handmade dataset]] which was devided into 3 classes based on their measured wear value. 
| class  | min value (micron) | max value (micron) |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| good   | 0                  | 130                |
| medium | 130                | 230                |
| bad    | 230                | âˆž                  |





===== Results =====
Results of this notebook are available on wandb as [[https://wandb.ai/dplars/pytorch-TWI_second_handmade?workspace=user-dplars|pytorch-TWI_second_handmade]]

Interesting results will be bespoken here;
Tests for different models: 
| model name | test accuracy % | validation accuracy% | transfer learning |
|------------|-----------------|----------------------|:------------------|
| Alexnet    | 100             | 100                  | yes               |
| Resnet18   | 100             | 95                   | no                |
| Densenet   | 100             | 85                   | yes               |
| Squeezenet | 100             | 85                   | yes               |
| VGG11_bn   | 100             | 90                   | no                |
										
An overview of the best runs for every model architecture. Since there are only nine test images; the test scores are set to a very high granularity. Further results of this test are to be found on wandb as [[https://wandb.ai/dplars/pytorch-TWI_second_handmade/reports/Testing-on-first-handmade-dataset--VmlldzozNTE5NzM|Testing on first handmade dataset]]


Trying to sweep over different parameter settings didn't work on my local computer; all runs failed or crashed
