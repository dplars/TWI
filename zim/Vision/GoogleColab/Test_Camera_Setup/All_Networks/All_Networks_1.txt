====== All Networks 1 ======
Created woensdag 02 december 2020

All networks 1 can be found [[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bWt0DgypiYoOOgnSGjlmSdDo7elvJnH4|here.]]

===== Network architectures =====
This model is used to test different model architectures namely:
* Resnet18
* Alexnet
* VGG11_bn
* Squeezenet
* Densenet

These models are all relatively small and should provide quite good results for a small dataset. 
More on why the models should work can be found [[Research:Vision Algorithm:camera position validation|here]]

===== Dataset =====

This algorithm had the input of images from the [[Vision:Dataset:Second handmade dataset|Second handmade dataset]] which was devided into 3 classes based on their measured wear value. 
| class  | min value (micron) | max value (micron) |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| good   | 0                  | 130                |
| medium | 130                | 230                |
| bad    | 230                | âˆž                  |
