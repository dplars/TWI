====== Test Camera Setup ======
Created woensdag 04 november 2020

To test the camera setup, a binary classification model is made. This model will tell with a treshold of 150 (200 the real treshold but 150 to warn before tool is worn out) wether a tool is good to work with or must be removed from the machine. 
This model should be trainable with as less images as possible, preferably 20 because that is the amount of pictures taken in one batch.
