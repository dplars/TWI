	  \subsection{A Review on Applications of Image Processing in Inspection of Cutting Tool Surfaces}
		--> goes out of the range of this paper... summarizes the different inspections which can be done
			machine vision
            
			\cite{Prabhu2015} Gives an overview of where image processing is used in the industry. They use a CCD camera to grab images which will be processed. Surfach roughness is another topic interesting for research to determine the wear of tools. This will not be covered in the scope of this paper. Toolwear measurement is done by indirect methods: empirical formulae. And by direct methods: Toolmaker microscope, graduated magnifying lens. To that date (2015) the accuracy of the measurements was 50 microns using vision based inspections. In this paper the accuracy will be pushed even more. Three parameters where used to estimate a degree of tool wear: vizual intensity histogram, image frequency domain content and spatial domain surface texture. Here it is said 40\% of all metal removal operations are drilling.
            
			The coating measurement, images taken using confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). 
			Surface defect inspection of cutting tool: coating defects occur onperiphery of cutting tools -> are observed as black or white spots in a different surrounding. this is detected using a fluorescent lamp to have highly diffused light
            
			The cost saved by automatic tool inspection is created by: cost of tool inserts, costs associated with non productive periods due to tool replacement.
