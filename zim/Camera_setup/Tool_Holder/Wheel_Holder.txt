Created Wednesday 28 October 2020

===== [[+first wheel holder|First Wheel Holder]]: =====
A simple wheel holder which can hold 20 inserts.
used for first tests and did work. Except the tools wern't fixed good enough or they were to hard to remove and insert into the holder.
The holder was printed badly and this made the print cleanup very labor intensive. 

===== [[+Second Wheel Holder|Second Wheel Holder:]] =====
Created on the base of the first wheel holder, but with an easier way of inserting and removing the tools. 
This with a more secure way of holding the tools. 
print so no cleanup must be done
