====== Wheel Holder ======
Created Wednesday 28 October 2020

To be able to quickly create a lot of photos in a consistant way, a wheel is designed to mount 20 tools at once; using a stepper motor and a fixed camera and lighting setup the process of taking images would be automated for every 20 tools. The holder will be 3D printed so a few wheels can be made to be able to swap the wheels with new tools for an efficient dataset creation.

After printing the wheel had to be cleared from rest pieces of plastic and had to be tested with a tool, this made it possible to scratch the tool extra hard which would mean the given labels for that tool aren't correct anymore. The tool used is from 3 number 6 36*. the manual removal also means the tools dont sit in the same position in every place on the wheel. This will show in the generated pictures.

This wheel is mounted on a stepper motor with step angle of 1.8 degrees.
We can calculate the accuracy for a wheel with a radius of 5.5cm (measured to the tip of the measured tool) 
grad to radials
2*pi/360*1.8= 0.0314159265359
sin(0.031415)*55 = 1.72754081497 mm

this gives an accuracy of 1.72 mm, this is not in the accuracy range that is needed for this project. In order to get the wanted displacement per step the rotations needs to be adjusted with extra gears in the system. A displacement of less than 0.5 mm would be good.

to achieve this the calculations are made backworth:
the required angle
arcsin(0.5/55) = 0.52 degrees 
calculate how the gears should relate to each other
1.8/0.52 = 3.46153846154

round this up to 4 and recalculate the displacement per step of the motor
the angle:
1.8/4 = 0.45
2*pi/360*0.45= 0.00785398163397
sin(0.00785398163397)*55 = 0.431964548879mm

This is whithin the needed displacement range.

This needs adjustment of the current design of the wheel holder also a 3d printed footer can be printed so the wheel can circulate vertically which would make the camera and light setup easier.

===== New tool holder thad makes it possible to insert and remove much easier =====
