====== 1 camera position side ======
Created woensdag 11 november 2020

Taken on the first 4 plates of batch 04 with red lighting only from the adressable led strips. 

1st light position is made with a setup with two led strips where one image is taken for every set of two led lights. 
output is bad. Reflection angle wasn't good.
