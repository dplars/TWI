===== [[./camera_position_validation.txt|Finding an algorithm to test the camera position setup]] =====
First there must be found an algorithm that can quickly confirm wether a setup is good or not. This will be done by taking pictures different camera positions with the same lichting. After this the images go trough a simple model and the output is verified with a test set. 
This algorithm must be as small as possible to not have to take a lot of pictures to determine wether an algorithm is good or not.
