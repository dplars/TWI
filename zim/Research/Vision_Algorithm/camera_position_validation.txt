====== camera position validation ======
Created woensdag 18 november 2020

===== Information =====
The next data input structure is made:
	* 20 train images
	* 10 validation images
	* 10 test images

These images will go through different algorithms multiple times and the outputs are verified for every different algorithm.

===== papers =====

1. A Comprehensive Study on Deep Image Classification with Small Datasets
	a. short comparison of the amount of convolutional layers to be used in the network (5 is optimal)
	b. comparison on datasets: Caltech101, CIFAR10
	c. also transfer learning also around 5 convolutional layers is the optimum
	d. network architecture
		1. from scratch:
			{{./paper1_arch_fromscratch.png}}
		2. transfer learning pretrained on VGG16 with imagenet dataset
			{{./paper1_arch_transferlearning.png}}
2. Deep learning for image classifification on very small datasets using transfer learning
	a. creation of an image classification network with context of where it comes from
		1. alexnet vs googlenet vs vgg and the history
		2. displays keras code to create the same models
		3. architecture for models is shown
		4. niet super interessant gezien hier nog steeds wordt gewerkt op 6000 fotos van katten en honden, wel een indicatie dat deep learning gaat met weinig data


3. https://paperswithcode.com/task/small-data
	a. interesting papers with small datasets

4. A survey of the recent architectures of deep convolutional neural networks
	a. overview of almost all neural networks with their strengths and weaknesses

5. SDD-CNN: Small data-driven convolution neural networks for subtle roller defect inspection
	a. very interesting paper detects faults in bearing rollers. 
	b. Using very little data
	c. results with from scratch training best with SDD-inception v3 and SDD-resnet18
	d. SDD-VGG16 gets good results, but with long trainin time

In most seen papers a very low learning rate
