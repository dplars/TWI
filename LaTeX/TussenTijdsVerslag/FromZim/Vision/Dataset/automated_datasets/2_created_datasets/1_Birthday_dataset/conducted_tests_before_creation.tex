Getting first full dataset with images of all plates



\subsection{First test}

first pictures formatted with 

b\_xxx\_p\_xxx\_l\_xxx.png

	-\textgreater{} these images where from last time checking some setups
	
	



\subsection{Second test}

formatting 

next pictures without changing for different led strips

b\_xxx\_p\_xxx\_color\_l\_xxx.png



\subsection{Third test}

formatting

pictures with full experiments on lid lighting

b\_xxx\_p\_xxx\_color\_strip\_l\_xxx\_bullet.png

a video is taken here 

Here we can see a difference with or without light in the room



reformatted last images to be able to see difference between different leds, bet setup and runs are the same

b\_xxx\_p\_xxx\_bullet\_l\_xxx\_color\_strip.png





possibly 3 and 4 no bullet wrong 

rest went okay just check the batches 3 and 4



\subsection{\href{../1_Birthday_dataset.tex}{Birthday dataset}}

batch 3 plate 7 no bullet:  had restants of 3D print plastic on worn area

batch 3 plate 8 no bullet:  is a bit off picture

from here in batch 3 plates go out of sight for no bullet side. 



bullet side is going the other way out of sight for batch 3 

batch four starts of with bad pictures (also b on the left out of sight and nb on the right side out of sight



from batch 4 plate 7 it is okay again



batch 5 plate 6 no bullet lighting not good

batch 5 plate 6 bullet has string from 3D printing on wear area



batch 11 plate 5 bullet had hair on wear area
