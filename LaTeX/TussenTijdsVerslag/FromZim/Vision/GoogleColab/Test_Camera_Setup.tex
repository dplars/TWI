		\section{Test Camera Setup}

Created woensdag 04 november 2020



To test the camera setup, a binary classification model is made. This model will tell with a treshold of 150 (200 the real treshold but 150 to warn before tool is worn out) wether a tool is good to work with or must be removed from the machine. 

This model should be trainable with as less images as possible, preferably 20 because that is the amount of pictures taken in one batch.





\subsection{\href{./Test_Camera_Setup/Resnet18.tex}{Resnet18}}

First we will try to implement SDD-Resnet18 to classify the few images in good or bad. 



\subsection{\href{./Test_Camera_Setup/inception_v3.tex}{inception v3}}

Than we will implement SDD-inception v3 



These described models should perform rather good without any transfer learning. 

After the first tests these results can be compared with a transfer learning model.





\subsection{\href{./Test_Camera_Setup/All_Networks.tex}{All Networks}}

For this all networks test, some networks where tested and an algorithm is created to make it possible to add more networks along the way
