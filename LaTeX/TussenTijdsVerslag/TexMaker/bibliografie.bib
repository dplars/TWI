@article{Ma2020,
abstract = {Rapid tool wear from milling TC18 (Ti-5Al-5Mo-5V-1Cr-1Fe) leads to increased surface deterioration and manufacturing costs. Here, a real-life tool wear experiment was introduced, and the three stages of tool wear were analyzed in detail according to the tool wear micro-topography and chemical elements. In the initial and normal stage, the tool wear was slow because of the protection of the adhesive titanium layer and dense alumina film. Diffusion wear and oxidation wear occurred until the sever wear stage. Based on the above wear mechanism determination, after acquiring the real time cutting force, the tool wear prediction models were established using a convolutional bi-directional long short-term memory networks (CNN + BILSTM) and a convolutional bi-directional gated recurrent unit (CNN + BIGRU). The results show that the errors of the predicted minimum values are all within 8{\%}, demonstrating that the deep learning method offers a new and promising approach for in monitoring tool wear on-line.},

@article{Pagani2020,
abstract = {In the growing Industry 4.0 market, there is strong need to implement automatic inspection methods to support manufacturing processes. Tool wear in turning is one of the biggest concerns that most expert operators are able to indirectly infer through the analysis of the removed chips. Automatising this operation would enable developing more efficient cutting processes that turns in easier process planning management toward the Zero Defect Manufacturing paradigm. This paper presents a deep learning approach, based on image processing applied to turning chips for indirectly identifying tool wear levels. The procedure extracts different indicators from the RGB and HSV image channels and instructs a neural network for classifying the chips, based on tool state conditions. Images were collected with a high-resolution digital camera during an experimental cutting campaign involving tool wear analysis with direct microscope imaging. The sensitivity analysis confirmed that the most sensible image channels are the hue value H that were used to teach the network, leading to performances in the range of 95 of proper classification. The feasibility of the deep learning approach for indirectly understanding the tool wear from the chip colour characterisation is confirmed. However, due to the big effects on chip colours of variables as the workpiece material and cutting process parameters, the applicability is limited to stable production flows. An industrial implementation can be foreseen by populating proper large databases and by implementing real-time chip segmentation analysis.},

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3 × 3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16–19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5{\%} and 17.0{\%}, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used nonsaturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the second-best entry.},
