\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conc}

This paper proposed a solution for the classification of tool wear on carbide inserts used in the milling industry and will be used for the validation of camera setups in a bigger research where the research question: How can tool wear on carbide inserts be quantized using a direct measurement method? will be answered. This will also lead to the answer on another research question where this will validate a vision set-up.

We obtained a full dataset of white and red pictures of 140 Carbide inserts. 

The needed depth of the algorithm was discussed where the more complex problem with different insert types needs a deeper neural network architecture

 With a test accuracy of 82.1\% on the mixed dataset, these results compare well to the state of the art where similar experiments where conducted with a test accuracy of 87\%. This is even outperformed with a test accuracy of 100\% on the dataset with only one type of insert.
 
\paragraph{Future work}
 This paper will be implemented to find the best method for tool wear quantisation on carbide inserts. The best set-up will be defined upon the results gathered with this research. This will be used to create a new and bigger dataset which will be used for image regression which will predict exact values for the tool wear.
 
 \paragraph{Planning}
A renewed planning is given in Appendix A.
